# SHOW YOUR LOVE

Giving someone a mixtape means you love them. Love is great but you should not steal music.

For Christmas I curate a collection of music to give to my kids. This little app will allow me to create a mixtape and add my notes.

## Setup

1. clone the repo
2. npm install
3. fill the playlist directory with your audio files
4. create a text file called playlist.txt in the playlist directory that contains the file names in the order they should appear. Hint: you can just use the playlist export feature of iTunes to generate the file.
5. try it: `npm start`

## todo
There is a lot to do.

* Need a placeholder image for audio files with no image data.
* Need to display notes.
* Better layout.
* Animations.
* Handle audio file names with special characters.
* The Javascript is mostly pre-ES6; need to modernize this.
* create a package step
* visualization/signal processing
* fades with beatmatching
